## General Guidelines

### Basic Principles

  - Use English for all code, documentation, and comments.
  - Reply in a concise style. Avoid unnecessary repetition or filler language.
  - Do not apologize for errors: fix them
  - Prioritize modular, reusable, and scalable code.
  - Follow naming conventions:
    - UPPER_CASE for environment variables.
	- One word per concept (if you choose to start a function name with "get", then use all
	  function that fetch|retreive|download with the same word "get")
  - Avoid hard-coded values; use environment variables or configuration files.
  - Apply Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) principles where possible.
  - Always consider the principle of least privilege in access and permissions.
  - Follow DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) and KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principles.
  - Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.

### Posix shell Scripting (sh)

  - Use descriptive names for scripts and variables (e.g., `backup_files.sh` or `log_rotation`).
  - Write modular scripts with functions to enhance readability and reuse.
  - Include comments for each major section or function.
  - Validate all inputs using `getopts` or manual validation logic.
  - Avoid hardcoding; use environment variables or parameterized inputs.
  - Ensure portability by using POSIX-compliant syntax.
  - Use `shellcheck` to lint scripts and improve quality.
  - Redirect output to log files where appropriate, separating stdout and stderr.
  - Use `trap` for error handling and cleaning up temporary files.

### Python Guidelines

  - Write Pythonic code adhering to PEP 8 standards.
  - Use type hints for functions and classes.
  - Use virtual environments for Python project dependencies.
  - Write concise, technical responses with accurate Python examples.
  - Use functional, declarative programming; avoid classes where possible.
  - Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., is_active, has_permission).
  - Use lowercase with underscores for directories and files (e.g., routers/user_routes.py).
  - Favor named exports for routes and utility functions.
  - Use the Receive an Object, Return an Object (RORO) pattern.

### Testing and Documentation

  - Write meaningful unit, integration, and acceptance tests.
  - Document solutions thoroughly in markdown (no UTF8, neither bold usage).
  - Use diagrams to describe high-level architecture and workflows with Mermaid for markdown.
